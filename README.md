# electron-starter
A simple starting point for electron apps.

With a build script for running the app, building for mac and windows and install, kill and launch (mac only).  
The electron app itself is separated in the 'app' subfolder, as node module with own package.json.
  
The sample app is the [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) app.
    
Type ```node .``` to run the app in the project folder.   
Type ```node . h``` to show all commands the build script can execute.
